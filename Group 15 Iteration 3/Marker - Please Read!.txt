this is a brief explanation of how the current iteration works.
 
Once you run the program you will see a setting menu you can 
1) select how many player their are
2) select how many of the players are human
3) select the difficulty of the computer if there is any
4) turn on or off colorblindmode
5) start the game.

will looked different from last iteration but is functionaly the same.
player number and how many human players are implimented but computer difficulty
and colorblindmode are not they set do variables but are not currently used.

once you start the game you will see and be able to do
1) the game board, a 20 x 20 grid where you can place your piece
2) the piece menu where you can select which piece you will be using
   (the first piece is always selected by default.)
3) the piece you have selected will have a preview on the board
   where it will be placed when you click the mouse.
controls
   you can rotate the piece with the mouse scroll wheel
   and flip with right click and place with left click.
   (the piece menu will update to show that the piece you place
   has been remove from your piece menu and will select the next avalible piece)
board rules
   placement of pieces will follow blockus rules (move validation)
   (turns not implimented so you can only place (player 1 / blue) pieces)
